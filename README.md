Change password with keccak256 hash.

Send message and event with correct password. Add a third parameter with a new hash of a different password.

Currently this is a test contract so the first function would need to be removed because there is no ownership requirement or have the current password required in order to change password. Note: this should be on top of an ownership requirement

Anybody can use this contract at the moment by changing the password.

This contract is restricted to my account and password.
